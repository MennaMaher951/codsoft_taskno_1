## Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning

*Description:*

* This repository contains the Python code used to build a machine learning model for predicting passenger survival in the Titanic disaster. The model is based on the Logistic Regression algorithm and trained using historical data from the Titanic dataset.

  *Key Elements:*

* Data preprocessing:
1. Import essential libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.).
2. Load the Titanic dataset.
3. Handle missing values (e.g., filling with mean/median).
4. Encode categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked).

* Exploratory data analysis (EDA):
1. Analyze characteristics of the data (e.g., passenger class, sex, age).
2. Visualize relationships between features and survival (e.g., count plots).

* Model training:
1. Separate features (X) and target variable (y).
2. Split data into training and testing sets (80%/20%).
3. Create a Logistic Regression model with regularization (e.g., L2 penalty).
4. Train the model on the training set.

* Model evaluation:
1. Calculate accuracy on the training and testing sets.
2. Perform cross-validation to estimate generalization ability.
3. Print evaluation scores in a clear and well-formatted manner.

* Code Structure:
1. Data loading and preprocessing: Load and clean the Titanic dataset.
2. Exploratory data analysis: Analyze and visualize the data.
3. Feature engineering: Encode categorical features.
4. Model training and evaluation: Train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model.
